### Description

This repository contains raw and processed data as supplemental material for the paper "The monoamine oxidase A inhibitor harmine potentiates retention in rodent brain of the psychedelic agent DMT without altering 5HT2A receptor occupancy or FDG uptake".

### Usage

The repo contains three folders (and subfolders) that each contain raw and analysed data from one methodological approach used in the experiments.

In general, each folder contains an **Analysis/Scripts** subfolder that contains the scripts that can be used in ascending order to recreate the data analysis and creation of plots and figures presented in the paper. 
Note: **03_KETANSERIN_and_MHMZ_DATA** does not contain these subfolders, but contains the scripts directly. 
All Scripts are also stored as HTML files in the corresponding **HTML_files** subfolders 

**01_brain_concentration_data** contains data of DMT, harmine and metabolite concentrations that were collected ex vivo for both experiments. 

**02_FDG_PET_data** contains FDG-PET data from the first experiment.

**03_KETANSERIN_and_MHMZ_DATA** contains 5HT2A receptor occupancy data from both experiments (DMT vs. ketanserin in experiment 1 and DMT vs. MH.MZ in experiment 2).
