### Description

This repository contains raw and processed data as supplemental material for the paper "A pilot study of cerebral metabolism and serotonin 5HT2A receptor occupancy in rats treated with the psychedelic tryptamine DMT in conjunction with the MAO inhibitor harmine" published in Frontiers in Pharmacology. 

DOI: [10.3389/fphar.2023.1140656](10.3389/fphar.2023.1140656)


### Usage

The repo contains three folders (and subfolders) that each contain raw and analysed data from one methodological approach used in the experiments.

In general, each folder contains an **Analysis/Scripts** subfolder with scripts that can be used in ascending order to recreate the data analysis and plots and figures presented in the paper. 
Note: **03_KETANSERIN_and_MHMZ_DATA** does not contain these subfolders, but contains the scripts directly. 
All Scripts are also stored as HTML files in the corresponding **HTML_files** subfolders.  

- **01_brain_concentration_data** contains data of DMT, harmine and metabolite concentrations that were collected ex vivo for both experiments. 

- **02_FDG_PET_data** contains FDG-PET data from the first experiment.

- **03_KETANSERIN_and_MHMZ_DATA** contains 5HT2A receptor occupancy data from both experiments (DMT vs. ketanserin in experiment 1 and DMT vs. MH.MZ in experiment 2).
